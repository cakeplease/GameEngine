VBO - vertex buffer object

array of all kinds of data

Create VBO:

Creating a VBO requires 3 steps:

1. Generate a new buffer object with glGenBuffers().
2. Bind the buffer object with glBindBuffer().
3. Copy vertex data to the buffer object with glBufferData().

1. glGenBuffers()
glGenBuffers() creates buffer objects and returns the IDs of the buffer objects.
It requires 2 parameters: the first one is the number of buffer objects to create, and the second parameter 
is the address of a GLuint variable or array to store a single ID or multiple IDs.

GLuint = Unsigned binary integer 32 bit

2. glBindBuffer()
Once the buffer object has been created, we need to hook the buffer object with the corresponding ID before using the buffer object.
glBindBuffer() takes 2 parameters: target and GLuint ID.

Target is a hint to tell VBO whether this buffer object will store vertex array data or index array data:
GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, or GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. 
Any vertex attributes, such as vertex coordinates, texture coordinates, normals and color component arrays should use GL_ARRAY_BUFFER. 
Index array which is used for glDraw[Range]Elements() should be tied with GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. 

Once glBindBuffer() is first called, VBO initializes the buffer with a zero-sized memory buffer and set the initial VBO states, such as usage and access properties.


3. glBufferData()
You can copy the data into the buffer object with glBufferData() when the buffer has been initialized.

To store data you have to convert them into a Floatbuffer first
FloatBuffer buffer = BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer(data.length);
		buffer.put(data);
		buffer.flip();
		return buffer;

usage: 
GL_STATIC_DRAW
GL_STATIC_READ
GL_STATIC_COPY
GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW
GL_DYNAMIC_READ
GL_DYNAMIC_COPY
GL_STREAM_DRAW
GL_STREAM_READ
GL_STREAM_COPY


"Static" means the data in VBO will not be changed (specified once and used many times), 
"dynamic" means the data will be changed frequently (specified and used repeatedly), and 
"stream" means the data will be changed every frame (specified once and used once). 
"Draw" means the data will be sent to GPU in order to draw (application to GL),
"read" means the data will be read by the client's application (GL to application), and 
"copy" means the data will be used both drawing and reading (GL to GL).


glDeleteBuffers()

You can delete a single VBO or multiple VBOs with glDeleteBuffers() if they are not used anymore. After a buffer object is deleted, its contents will be lost.




VAO - vertex arrays list
object in which you can store data about a 3d model.
It has a lot of slots in which you can store data called attribute lists.
Each VAO has a ID.

Creating VAO:

1. glGenVertexArrays()
2. glBindVertexArray()

Unbinding:

glBindVertexArray(0)
