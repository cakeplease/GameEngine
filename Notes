VBO - vertex buffer object

array of all kinds of data

Create VBO:

Creating a VBO requires 3 steps:

1. Generate a new buffer object with glGenBuffers().
2. Bind the buffer object with glBindBuffer().
3. Copy vertex data to the buffer object with glBufferData().

1. glGenBuffers()
glGenBuffers() creates buffer objects and returns the IDs of the buffer objects.
It requires 2 parameters: the first one is the number of buffer objects to create, and the second parameter 
is the address of a GLuint variable or array to store a single ID or multiple IDs.

GLuint = Unsigned binary integer 32 bit

2. glBindBuffer()
Once the buffer object has been created, we need to hook the buffer object with the corresponding ID before using the buffer object.
glBindBuffer() takes 2 parameters: target and GLuint ID.

Target is a hint to tell VBO whether this buffer object will store vertex array data or index array data:
GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, or GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. 
Any vertex attributes, such as vertex coordinates, texture coordinates, normals and color component arrays should use GL_ARRAY_BUFFER. 
Index array which is used for glDraw[Range]Elements() should be tied with GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. 

Once glBindBuffer() is first called, VBO initializes the buffer with a zero-sized memory buffer and set the initial VBO states, such as usage and access properties.


3. glBufferData()
You can copy the data into the buffer object with glBufferData() when the buffer has been initialized.

To store data you have to convert them into a Floatbuffer first
FloatBuffer buffer = BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer(data.length);
		buffer.put(data);
		buffer.flip();
		return buffer;

usage: 
GL_STATIC_DRAW
GL_STATIC_READ
GL_STATIC_COPY
GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW
GL_DYNAMIC_READ
GL_DYNAMIC_COPY
GL_STREAM_DRAW
GL_STREAM_READ
GL_STREAM_COPY


"Static" means the data in VBO will not be changed (specified once and used many times), 
"dynamic" means the data will be changed frequently (specified and used repeatedly), and 
"stream" means the data will be changed every frame (specified once and used once). 
"Draw" means the data will be sent to GPU in order to draw (application to GL),
"read" means the data will be read by the client's application (GL to application), and 
"copy" means the data will be used both drawing and reading (GL to GL).


glDeleteBuffers()

You can delete a single VBO or multiple VBOs with glDeleteBuffers() if they are not used anymore. After a buffer object is deleted, its contents will be lost.



VAO - vertex arrays list
object in which you can store data about a 3d model.
It has a lot of slots in which you can store data called attribute lists.
Each VAO has a ID.

Creating VAO:

1. glGenVertexArrays()
2. glBindVertexArray()

Unbinding:

glBindVertexArray(0)


SHADERS/shader programming!

Writes in OpenGL shading language (GLSL)

Shader programs: vertex shader and fragment shader that works together to render a scene

Vertex shader - executes one time for each vertex in the object that is being rendered and
each time it uses the vertex data we stored in the object's VAO as the input to the vertex shader program 

Input to the vertex shader are the coordinates (x, y, z) of the vertex that was currently being processed

We have to make Vertex shader do two things with this data:

1. It has to determinate the position of where the vertex that it's processing should be rendered on to the screen 
2. The vertex shader uses the input executes the program and outputs "something". This output is only used as inputs to the fragment shader so
you choose what you need them to be  

Fragment shader - executes one time for every pixel that the object covers on the screen.
Each time it runs it uses the output of the vertex shader to calculate what the final color for that pixel should be,
so the output of the fragment shader is always an RGB color, the color of the pixel that is being processed 





vertex shader:

//version of opengl
#version 400 core

//declare input, position of the vertex from VAO
in vec3 position;

//declare output, conversion of position to colour
out vec3 colour;

//the method that runs every time a vertex is processed by this vertex shader
void main(void) {
	
	//tell OpenGL where to render this vertex on the screen
	//you can also write position.xyz or just position
	
	gl_Position = vec4(position.x, position.y, position.z, 1.0);
	
	//create output colour
	colour = vec3(position.x+0.5, 1.0, position.y+0.5);
	
}


fragment shader:

//version of OpenGL
#version 400 core

//declare input, it is the output from the vertex shader
in vec3 colour;

//the color of the pixel that is currently proccesing
out vec4 out_Colour;

void main(void) {

	//convert input colour to the output colour
	out_Colour = vec4(colour, 1.0);

}


Recap:

We have a rectangle with four vertices:

-0.5f, 0.5f, 0,
-0.5f, -0.5f, 0,
0.5f, -0.5f, 0,
0.5f, 0.5f, 0

They are stored in a attribute list in a VAO.

The VERTEX shader has access to those positions in form of a vec3 position variable. 
The vertex shader executes for each vertex and uses these input positions to first to tell the GPU where on the screen it should
be rendered. We do this by setting gl_Position = vec4(position, 1.0)

Then the vertex shader calculates the colour for each vertex based on the position of that vertex:
colour = vec3(position.x + 0.5, 1.0, position.y + 0.5), red, green and blue and produces colour outputs.

The FRAGMENT shader executes for each pixel to decide what colour it should be.
The input colour for each one of the fragment shader is the mix of output colours from the vertex shader.



 In the order to use those shader programs we need to be able to access those from java code (abstract class ShaderProgram) for all shader programs.
